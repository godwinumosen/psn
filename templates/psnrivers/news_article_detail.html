    <p>
      The Executive Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, Rivers State Branch,
      has released comprehensive updated guidelines for community pharmacy practice.
      These guidelines are designed to align local practices with national standards
      and international best practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      The new guidelines address several key areas:
    </p>

    <!-- List -->
    <ol class="ps-3">
      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong>Patient Counseling Standards</strong><br>
        All community pharmacies are now required to provide dedicated counseling areas
        where patients can discuss their medications in private. Pharmacists must ensure
        adequate time is allocated for patient education, particularly for new medications
        or complex regimens.
      </li>

      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong>Medication Safety Protocols</strong><br>
        Enhanced protocols for medication dispensing have been introduced, including
        mandatory double-checking systems for high-risk medications and improved labeling
        requirements.
      </li>

      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong>Documentation Requirements</strong><br>
        Community pharmacies must maintain comprehensive records of dispensed medications,
        patient counseling sessions, and any adverse drug reactions reported by patients.
      </li>

      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong>Continuing Professional Development</strong><br>
        Pharmacists are required to complete a minimum of 40 CPD hours annually, with at
        least 10 hours focused on patient safety and medication management.
      </li>

      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong>Premises Standards</strong><br>
        Updated requirements for pharmacy premises include improved storage conditions
        for medications, adequate lighting, and proper waste disposal systems for expired
        or damaged medications.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The guidelines take effect from January 1, 2025, with a six-month transition period
      for full compliance. The PSN Rivers will conduct orientation sessions for community
      pharmacists to ensure smooth implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Members are encouraged to download the complete guidelines document from the members’
      portal and attend the upcoming orientation workshops.
